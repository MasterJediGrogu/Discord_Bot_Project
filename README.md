# Discord_Bot_Project
I moved my original project here into this new repo.
In the original repo, the bot token was open to the public
which presented a security risk to users and myself. 

This project is a Discord bot that communicates with a weather API.
In the future, I plan to include other components such as surverying local traffic
reports, security reports on users accessing/communicating on Discord chats.
